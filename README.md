<h3 align="center"> Welcome to my R Programming Projects </h3>
<br/>
<h4>  ðŸŒ± Check out how I cleaned, prepared and analysed data </h4>

<p> - Cleaning data and working with different packages, lists, vectors, operators and pipes and bias testing</p>
<p> - Analyses of Palmer Penguins data to clean, manipulate, annotate and visualise the correlation between penguin size and flipper size with creation of an R Markdown report document</p>
<p> - Analyses of Diamonds data to visualise using different aesthetics based on the cut and clarity.</p>
